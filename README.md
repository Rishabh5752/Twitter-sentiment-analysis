# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
This is a tool which helps in analysing the sentiment of tweets made by users on Twitter by using NLP(natural language proessing), and fetches the real-time data using Tweepy and Twitter developer account. For privacy reasons, I have not shown my authentication key.

AUTHENTICATION:-
For authentication, I applied for a Twitter developer account from which I got the the authentication key which is important to establish the connection between the real-time data and the tool.
